### Security updates ###
# These are not directly needed, but we need to bump up versions used by our 
# dependencies to avoid security issues in older versions:
smallvec = "0.6.14"

### Dependency updates ###
# Other updates to versions our transitive dependencies use:
#
# TODO:
# rusqlite uses libsqlite3-sys.  this version bundles sqlite 3.41.
# Previous versions (3.39-3.40 at least) have a performance regression.
# libsqlite3-sys: TODO VERSION: https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/pull/1294
